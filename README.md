### 🌍 About Me
I bring together two strands of environmental science:  
- **Cornell (MS Thesis):** Groundwater & hydrology research using the Thornthwaite–Mather water balance method to model water table responses under rice intensification and climate change.  
- **UC Davis (Current):** Air quality data QA/QC for the IMPROVE and CSN networks, developing anomaly detection (PM2.5/PM10 ratios, speciation consistency checks, flow validations) and automating data pipelines.  

My focus is on **building tools that improve the reliability of environmental datasets** — whether it’s climate–hydrology interactions or air monitoring networks — using **data science, QA/QC, and anomaly detection**.

### 🚧 Coming Soon
I’m currently working on two integrated projects as part of my **1 commit a day challenge**:  
- **Env Data QA/QC Toolkit** → anomaly detection and dashboards for PM2.5/PM10 and speciation data.  
- **Hydrology Module** → Thornthwaite–Mather PET & water balance (CHIRPS + NASA POWER).  

Both are under active development and will be released once the first versions are polished.

### 📈 Now
- Doing a **1 commit a day challenge** → building a recruiter-ready portfolio step by step.  
- Preparing an integrated open-source repo that combines hydrology + air quality QA/QC methods.  
- Exploring **Google Earth Engine** and cloud pipelines to make environmental data tools accessible.
